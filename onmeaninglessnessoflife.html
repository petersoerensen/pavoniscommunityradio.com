    <h1>On the Meaninglessness of Life</h1>
    <p>In the book "Beautiful World, Where Are You" Sally Rooneys characters
    ruminate over the meaning of life, and the morals and ethics of doing
    good deeds and obeying god.</p>
    <p>
      A recurring sentiment is that life is all random and that there is no meaning
      to life. I don't think this is true. Not because I believe that life is meaningful,
      but because I believe that it is impossible for life to be devoid of meaning.
      For what does it mean for something to be devoid of meaning?
    </p>
    <p>
    Let's start with the example of the sky. In the day, the sky is blue,
    but at night the sky is devoid of colour. In order for the sky to be devoid,
    it must initially be able to have the attribute of colour. The sky can be blue,
    or any of the many colours the sky might have, or it can be devoid of colour,
    and let the light of the starts and the moon shine through. If the sky was
    not able to have a colour at all, how could we deem it devoid of any colour.
    That would just be thee natural state of things.
